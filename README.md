# 99.co Backend Test

This repo contains 3 folders:

- listing-service (python - default test repo)
- user-service (golang - new)
- public-api (golang - new)

Ideally these folder must be separated folder.

## Running The Application

This section contains steps to run each back-end application

### Listing Service

To run listing service already explained in the listing-service `README.md`

### User Service

Open folder user-service in the VSCode, then go to **Terminal -> Run Task -> Run Go User Service**

### Public API

Open folder public-api in the VSCode, then go to **Terminal -> Run Task -> Run Go Public API**

## Testing The Back-end Application

I have included `endpoints.postman_collection.json` which contains collection of all endpoints, just import the collection into postman and execute each request.
